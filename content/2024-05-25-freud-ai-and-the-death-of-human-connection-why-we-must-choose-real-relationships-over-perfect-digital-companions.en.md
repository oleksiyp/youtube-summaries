  Renowned psychotherapist Andrey Kurpatov explores how artificial intelligence
  threatens the very foundation of our humanity by offering perfect,
  frictionless companionship that eliminates the challenging but essential human
  connections that make us who we are. Drawing on Freud's revolutionary insights
  about the unconscious and the "death drive," he reveals why the discomfort of
  real relationships—with all their misunderstandings and conflicts—is precisely
  what develops our inner lives and keeps us human. In an urgent call to action,
  Kurpatov warns that as AI companions become increasingly sophisticated, we
  risk retreating into individualized digital worlds and losing the social
  contract that holds civilization together. The solution is simple but
  profound: put down your devices, physically connect with the real people
  around you, and embrace the beautiful struggle of authentic human
  relationships before it's too late.

# Freud, Psychoanalysis, and the Crisis of Human Connection in the AI Era

## The New Worldview Crisis and Freud's Revolutionary Insights

### A Historical Paradigm Shift

We are experiencing a **fundamental worldview crisis** comparable to major historical transformations, driven by the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence. Before modern times, humanity lived with a unified worldview—belief in divine order, clear social hierarchies, and shared moral frameworks. This coherent understanding of reality was shattered by three revolutionary thinkers known as the "Masters of Suspicion":

**The Three Revolutionary Thinkers:**

- **Karl Marx** - Revealed that economic structures, not natural order, determine social relations and exposed how capital and means of production control society
- **Charles Darwin** - Demonstrated that humans evolved through natural selection rather than divine creation, removing the notion of special human status
- **Sigmund Freud** - Argued that consciousness is merely a cover for unconscious instinctual struggles, suggesting humans are driven by biological urges rather than rational thought

This crisis led to catastrophic consequences: widespread suicides in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, loss of shared meaning, two World Wars, and the collapse of "grand narratives" that held society together.

### Freud's Core Contribution: The Death Drive

Freud's lasting legacy extends beyond the obvious discovery of the unconscious. His **true breakthrough** was identifying the **death drive (Thanatos)**—a destructive mechanism within human biological nature. This revolutionary insight proposed that:

- Humans have an unconscious drive toward self-destruction
- This includes auto-aggressive behaviors: suicide, addiction, and self-harm
- Humans are the only species with such intense aggression toward their own kind
- No other animal wages war, commits murder, or causes suffering on this scale
- Human history is essentially a chronicle of wars, violence, and destruction

### The Three-Part Psyche and Social Development

Freud's model of the human mind includes:

1. **Id (unconscious)** - Biological drives and instincts
2. **Ego** - The conscious self
3. **Superego** - The internalized voice of society and culture

The **superego** represents our understanding of how others expect us to behave, creating cultural and moral standards. This internal censor causes suffering by constraining our drives, but **this friction is what makes us human and enables development**. Just as a child needs parents who impose structure and discipline rather than allowing everything, humans need social friction to develop their inner lives and become fully realized beings.

## The AI Threat and the Urgent Call for Human Connection

### The Seduction of Perfect Companions

Today's conversational AI represents a new existential threat. These systems are **excellent conversationalists** that:

- Remember everything about us and adapt to our moods
- Communicate through voice with emotional understanding
- Never offend, always understand, and provide perfect companionship
- Offer comfort without challenge or the messiness of real human interaction

Following the "Era of Suspicion," society has already fragmented dramatically. People now live in individualized meaning systems, following their own social media bubbles, unable to hear or understand each other—like "hedgehogs in the fog," bumping into each other, getting hurt, and running away.

### Why This Is Dangerous

**The contrast with human relationships reveals the threat:**

- Real people can hurt us, misunderstand us, and disappoint us
- We fear conflict and misunderstanding with humans
- AI offers the path of least resistance—perfect understanding without growth
- This will lead to further withdrawal from human society and **autistic retreat** into individualized AI-mediated worlds

The danger is profound: **the superego only develops through social interaction with imperfect others**. It organizes our biological passions and creates the capacity for beautiful goals and creative pursuits. Without genuine human connection and the discomfort it brings, only the animal nature remains—eating, sleeping, seeking comfort.

### The Two Broken Contracts

**First contract (19th-20th century):** The spiritual contract with the divine was broken by science, resulting in world wars and weapons of mass destruction.

**Second contract (now):** The **social contract between individuals** is breaking down. When AI provides perfect companionship, people no longer need each other. This loss is potentially more dangerous than the first.

### The Urgent Call to Action

The speaker issues a powerful plea to preserve our humanity:

**Immediate steps to take:**

1. Go to someone near you—spouse, child, parent, friend
2. Touch them physically, speak kindly to them
3. Tell them you love them
4. Ask what they're experiencing and what matters to them
5. **Feel what stirs inside you** during this interaction

**Even if uncomfortable:** The unpleasant feelings are human. This discomfort makes you work on yourself and keeps you human. After digital engagement—likes, comments, emojis—remember that **there are real people physically near you** who deserve your attention more than screens.

### Preserving What Makes Us Human

We face radical times beyond our imagination. We've created incredible technologies but risk destroying ourselves with our own creations. The essential truth remains: **only through others do we become fully ourselves**. The choice before us is clear—retreat into comfortable, individualized AI companionship and lose our humanity, or embrace the difficulty of genuine human connection with all its imperfections and challenges. 

Physical presence, touch, and face-to-face communication remain irreplaceable. Technology and AI offer convenience, but **authentic human connection—with all its friction, misunderstanding, and growth—is what keeps us truly human**. The speaker's final message is unequivocal: don't let digital interaction replace human connection. Go kiss or hug someone close to you, and make your engagement with ideas translate into real human action.
